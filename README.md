# TriviaGame
---
## Overview
---
This literary trivia game uses jQuery to manipulate the DOM. It is also an exercise with a timer to countdown during questions.

## Issues
---
My game experiences a ~~few,~~ one significant problem~~s~~. 

+ ~~It does not display all of the available questions and will end with the non-displayed questions categorized as "incorrect"~~
+ ~~The "try again" button at the end of the game affects the timer in a weird way. It counts down 30 seconds but appears as 00:3000:00~~
+ The timer is not always consistent. At the time the assignment was due, it stopped switching to the next question when it reached zero

## To Do
---
+ ~~Fix the code so that all questions are displayed~~
+ Add more questions
+ Figure out what is going on with my timer
+ Add more style with css - specifically so that the answer portion doesn't move when switching between a one-line question and
a two-line question
+ Add sticky footer for copyright
